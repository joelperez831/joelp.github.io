My name is Joel Perez. I am currently a UCLA student majoring in statistics. I grew up in the "Salad Bowl of California", the Central Coast a.k.a. the most overlooked part of California. I used to walk by the fields and the field workers everyday to get to high school. My dad worked in the fields as did his dad as did his. I did not have no intention of going to college after high school, but after awhile, my dad convinced me to go to community college, where I discovered my love for mathematics and programming.
- I got my associate's degree in mathematics from community college with SUMMA CUM LAUDE. Although, some might not think of this as a big achievement, it was to my family as I was the first do so. I continued my determination to break the cycles my family had seemed to become stagnant in. I became the first of my family to transfer to a university.

- It wasn't until my seond quarter of UCLA when I discovered a beautiful combination of mathematics and programming known as data science. I changed my major from mathematics to statistics. Since then, I been on a path of both self-teaching combined with univserity clalsses to become a data scientist.
