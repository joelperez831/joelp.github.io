##**Sentiment Analysis on Rick and Morty**:  
###After reading *Text Mining with R*, I was trying to think of a project I could apply what I had learned. It wasn't until I came across this blog post by Tamas Szilagyi: [A TIDY TEXT ANALYSIS OF RICK AND MORTY](http://tamaszilagyi.com/blog/a-tidy-text-analysis-of-rick-and-morty/)  that my eyes were opened.

### As a huge Rick and Morty fan, the idea of combining text analysis and my favorite show was perfect. I did my best to make this project my own. I looked online for the subtitles and began cleaning up the text. I started with looking at the overall sentiment of the show.  
```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE,fig.width=7, fig.height=5}
library(dplyr) 
library(tidytext) 
library(subtools) 
library(tidyr)
library(igraph) 
library(ggraph) 
library(ggplot2) 
library(magick)

a <- read.subtitles.serie(dir = "C:/Users/Joey/Desktop/randm/series/")
df <- subDataFrame(a) 
df$Text <- tolower(df$Text) 
df$Text<- gsub("[[:punct:]]","", df$Text)
tidydf <- df %>% unnest_tokens(word, Text) %>% anti_join(stop_words %>% 
                                                            rbind(data.frame(word=c("xhmikosr","www.addic7ed.com","sync","corrections"),lexicon = "custom")))
nrcSent <- get_sentiments("nrc")
randmSent <- tidydf %>% inner_join(nrcSent)
ggplot(randmSent, aes(sentiment)) + geom_bar(fill = "orange", color = "black")
```
