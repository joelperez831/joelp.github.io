<h3>After reading <em>Text Mining with R</em>, I was trying to think of a project I could apply what I had learned.

<pre><code>## [1] &quot;Sentiment of Rick and Morty By Season: &quot;</code></pre>
<img src="/post/2017-11-06-test-page_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="672" /> #Top negative and positive sentiments:<br />
<img src="/post/2017-11-06-test-page_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="672" /> #### One thing to note is that mother is regarded as both negative and positive, hence why it is filled with two colors. My hypothesis is that it depends on the context of how mother is being used. Another interesting find is that the most common word in each season is god. The show is known for questioning the existence of god, which I was suprised to see how often the word god is actually mentioned. However, the context of how god is usually used as in a phrase like: “Oh my god”, which is not usually a good thing. Nevertheless, this could be why the overall sentiment analysis of Rick and Morty might be a misrepresentation. Will look more into this later.<br />

<h3>Number of times each character is mentioned per season:</h3>
<p><img src="/post/2017-11-06-test-page_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="672" /> #### It’s not suprising that the most mentioned characters of Rick and Morty are Rick and Morty. However, we can see Morty was the real star of the first season. He was mentioned about twice as much as Rick and after the first season, he dropped all the way down. Justin Roiland, the voice of Rick and Morty, said he felt Rick saying “Morty” was a verbal crutch and wanted to try to get rid of it. As we can see by the graph, he really did follow through.</p>

<p><img src="/post/2017-11-06-test-page_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="576" /> We can see from that the top positions for each season are: meeseeks, unity and pickle, which, if you watch Rick and Morty, is not so suprising. One thing I loved is the word “noob” made the list. Again, if you watch Rick and Morty, you know there is a character called, “Noob Noob”, who is one of my favorite temporary side characters on the show.</p>
