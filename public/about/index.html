      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My name is Joel Perez. I am currently a UCLA student majoring in statistics. I grew up in the &ldquo;Salad Bowl of California&rdquo;, the Central Coast a.k.a. the most overlooked part of California. I was surrounded by nothing but fields. I&rsquo;d have to walk by the fields and the field workers everyday to get to high school. It served as a constant reminder of the work ethic of my culture. It was an inspiration. However, I did not have any intention of going to college after high school. I just wanted to go straight into the workforce. After about a year after I graduated high school, my dad convinced me to go to try community college, where I discovered my love for mathematics and programming.<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got my associate&rsquo;s degree in mathematics from community college with SUMMA CUM LAUDE. Although, some might not think of this as a big achievement, it was to my family as I was the first do so. I continued my determination to break the cycles my family had seemed to become stagnant in. I became the first of my family to transfer to a university.<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t until my second quarter of UCLA when I discovered a beautiful combination of mathematics and programming known as data science. I changed my major from mathematics to statistics. Since then, I been on a path of both self-teaching combined with university classes to become a data scientist.</p>
