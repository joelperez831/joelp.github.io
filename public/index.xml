      <description>Sentiment Analysis on Rick and Morty: (WARNING: STRONG LANGUAGE APPEARS IN THIS TEXT ANALYSIS)After reading Text Mining with R, I was trying to think of a project I could apply what I had learned.

      <description>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; My name is Joel Perez. I am currently a UCLA student majoring in statistics. I grew up in the &amp;ldquo;Salad Bowl of California&amp;rdquo;, the Central Coast a.k.a. the most overlooked part of California. I was surrounded by nothing but fields. I&amp;rsquo;d have to walk by the fields and the field workers everyday to get to high school. It served as a constant reminder of the work ethic of my culture.</description>
